# Electric Equivalent Calculator

Hello,

This is my first program, which I made using basic commands in the Python language.

Have you ever needed to quickly calculate the equivalent of resistance connected in parallel or capacitance connected in series at the start of a journey in electrical engineering?

This program was made to save some time on those easy but time-consuming calculations.

## How to use
1. Start the program.
2. Choose how your elements are connected (parallel/series).
3. Select the elements you want to calculate.
2. Specify how many elements you need to calculate.
3. Enter the values for each of the selected elements.
4. The program will print the results.
